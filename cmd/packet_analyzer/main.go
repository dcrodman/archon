// This utility stands up an HTTP server that receives packet data from a PSOBB server,
// persists it in a common format, and can perform some basic analysis. Primarily
// intended for comparing which packets are exchanged between the client and different
// server implementations for comparison with tools like diff.
//
// Note that this utility is mostly only useful in the context of local development,
// due if nothing else to the overhead incurred by the servers having to send every
// packet over an HTTP POST.
//
// Commands:
//     capture (default): starts a server waiting for packets to be submitted
//	   compact: generates a more human-readable version of session data (useful for tools like diff)
//	   summarize: similar to compact but only the packet types are included
//
// In order to use the capture utility, there must be a value set for packet_analyzer_address
// in Archon's config.yaml.
